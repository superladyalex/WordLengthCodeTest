# Word Length Project

### Setup

##### Java 8
Can be downloaded/installed either though the link below our if you use homebrew through the command below
 - https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/javase-jdk8-downloads.html
 - using brew: brew cask install adoptopenjdk/openjdk/adoptopenjdk8
 
##### Maven
 using brew:  brew install maven
 else: http://maven.apache.org/install.html
 

##### IDE
I'm using IntelliJ which can be downloaded through this link but any IDE (or none) could theoretically be used.
- InteliJ CE https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/
 
 

### Assumptions
1) Added secondary sort to be alphabetical 
  Note: There is an additional important note that capital letters sort before lowercase letters
2) Removed non-alphanumeric chars so those are not counted in word length
